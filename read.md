Project Overview:
This project aims to deepen the understanding of breast cancer survival trends and enhance prediction models for patient outcomes. By leveraging advanced statistical techniques and machine learning, the project seeks to analyze survival rates and accurately predict the 10-year mortality risk for breast cancer patients. The ultimate objective is to improve treatment planning, patient counseling, and overall cancer care strategies.

Project Benefits: 
Treatment Optimization: The models will help identify factors influencing breast cancer survival, allowing for more targeted and personalized treatment approaches. 
Patient Counselling: Accurate prediction of 10-year mortality risk can assist in providing patients with more precise prognosis information. 
Research Direction: Understanding survival patterns can guide future research efforts in breast cancer treatment and prevention.

Deliverables: 
A machine learning model specifically designed for predicting 10-year mortality risk in breast cancer patients. 
Comprehensive data visualizations illustrating relationships between various factors and patient outcomes. 
A comparative analysis of different machine learning algorithms for the prediction task.

Project Guidelines: 
Data Exploration: Conduct comprehensive EDA using visualization techniques to understand feature distributions and relationships with survival outcomes. 
Survival Analysis: Implement Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox Proportional Hazards models to analyze survival patterns. 
Feature Engineering: Apply appropriate scaling techniques for numerical variables and consider feature importance analysis. 
Model Selection: Evaluate various classification algorithms including Logistic Regression, SVM, and Decision Trees for predicting 10-year mortality risk. 
Performance Evaluation: Use appropriate metrics such as accuracy, ROC-AUC to assess model performance. 
Visualization: Create clear and informative visualizations using libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to communicate survival analysis results and model performance. 
Code Quality: Ensure well-structured, commented Python code following best practices. 
(Optional)Project could also include advanced statistical techniques such as:
